# Staking Auction (Concept)

This code is a basic implementation of what I call a Staking Auction. It is a concept which slightly rethinks how auctions work.
In this model, auction bidders that did not win the auction are still rewarded with a percentage of the final price, depending on how much they percentually increased the price with their bids.
